# Pic To N64

## What is it?
Initially this was designed to just replace the N64's standard analogue stick with a modern one from the Gamecube. That was relatively succesdfull but allot of it was done without me having much understanding of what i was actually doing. It was a very and copy paste job. So now i'm restarting from scratch. First of with a hello world of sorts, talking to the PIC's ADC.
